    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <P>
      JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.<br>
      As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.<br> 
      All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.<br>
      JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.<br>
      It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.<br> 
      It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
